            <h3>Lindsey Rexroad</h3>
            <p>I used to be a teacher. I loved my job, I loved my students. However, I found
                that I loved using my creativity to inspire them more than I liked the content I 
                taught. I wanted more from myself. I was telling my students to live their dreams
                while they were young enough to, but I wasn't following my own advice. I started to ask
                myself, "What are my dreams?". I knew I loved being creative. I knew I loved working with
                technology. I knew I loved the environment. I knew I loved to travel. What I didn't know was how to bring all of those
                passions together.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day I was making 150 copies of the same worksheets and articles I had been making the last two years. I 
                thought about all the paper I was wasting, even though I utilized the front, back, and multipage
                print options. I thought about my students who continuously are on their phones, and how I could easily 
                take all my files from the computer and put it on an app for my students. They would have access
                to everything at home.  I started looking around, I knew there had to be a way. I came across codecademy and 
                started learning through them. I finally realized I would need a lot more intense and guided instruction, when I found
                <a href="skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>Though my plans for creating an app for my students has changed, I am still driven to find 
                creative ways to use techonolgy and coding for others.

            <h3>My inspiration</h3>
            <p class="about-me-text">
                    Tranquility and Harmony are the two things that inspire my designs. I aspire to 
                    create designs that flow naturally and create calm for those who look at it. We 
                    all know how stressful it can be to navigate a website that you don't know much 
                    about. I aim to take the struggle away from the viewer and give them an experience 
                    that is easily navigable and a pleasant experience.

                I learned to code CSS and HTML5 after I noticed the amount of paper I was using that was not necessary. 
                I hoped to create apps for my students to use for my curriculum. I quickly learned that I loved everything 
                about coding and it let me harness my creativity and gave me an outlet as well. I signed up for Skillcrush 
                eight months later after trying to teach myself on my own and started learning more about the world of CSS 
                and HTML5. As of right now, I have finished two classes and will be starting on the third, which focuses on 
                Git, Github and the Command Line, soon.
